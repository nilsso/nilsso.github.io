A collection of some of my projects that I like to show-off:

- [ACM Data Dump](/apps/acm)
- [Japanese Fragment Generator](/apps/japanese) /
  A React web application I wrote to help myself and other students study for Japanese language
  classes. Lists of sentences, expressions and vocabulary are stored as modules in a [Json
  file](/apps/lang_modules/japanese_modules.json), which the app compiles together and uses to build
  random fragments (fragments like "<code>My major is {{major}}</code>" where <code>{{major}}</code>
  would be replaced with vocabulary on fragment population).

- [Polytopes!](/apps/polytopes) /
  A [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) based rendering tool for visualizing convex
  [polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope). I wrote this to help visualize content in a
  math subject course on semigroups and combinatorics, and last I heard some students were still
  using it in later classes.
