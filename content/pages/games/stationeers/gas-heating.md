## Heat system
Heat generated by generators or boosters and is stored in an insulated tank filled with pollutant.
This tank is a heat buffer for the gas heating buffer room. Excess heat is vented into the
atmosphere.

## Buffer Room
This room is filled with water and contains a buffer system for each gas. Temperature in the room is
modified by connections to the atmosphere (to cool) and to the heat system (to heat), both separated
by digital valves. The heating system valve is open while the temperature is below the target, and
closed while at or above. The atmosphere valve is open while the temperature is above the target,
and closed while at or below the target. These two valves allow the buffer room temperature to
fluctuate above and below the target temperature until the target is met (or at least to within some
error).

## Buffer room gas buffers
If the room temperature tank is below the pressure target, gas is imported from the external storage
into the gas buffer. When the buffer room temperature and the gas buffer temperature both reach
target, gas from the buffer is dumped into the room temperature tank.
