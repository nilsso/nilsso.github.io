## Switching to `pyright` ðŸª¨

It turned out that `pylsp` wasn't all that I thought it was, and I've switch to Microsoft's LSP,
`pyright`. It's job is to do, in addition to a limited amount of linting (which I'll
probably turn off), the static type-checking that I was using `mypy` for, except even better:
finally `match` statement support! This left me to re-include `null-ls` for formatting with `black`
and `isort`, and diagnostics with `pylama`. But there were a few problems.

## Fixing `null-ls` and `pylama` ðŸ¦™

Firstly, the problem with `pylama` was that it only looks for a configuration file
<kbd>pylama.ini</kbd> within the current working directory (cwd), or else a user configuration file
<kbd>~/.pylama.ini</kbd>. I have a feeling this does the job for many IDE whose linting program
command runners always start at the project root, but the problem for me was two-fold:
I'm not using an IDE and the working directory is a subfolder where the file I'm working on is;
and `null-ls` seems to have its own thoughts on where to place the root/cwd.

To fix `pylama`, [I forked it][fork] and changed how it looks for configuration files to having it traverse
up the `cwd` parent tree until it reaches `~`, looking for any config file along the way. I might
want to change this to have it in general stop at the base of the nearest module, but then it
wouldn't work for this particular project.

Running `pylama` from the terminal while in a subdirectory now finds the project config, hooray!
But it didn't work within `nvim`; the problem was that `null-ls` gives its sources a particular root
directory, and in this case it was giving the repository directory <kbd>project</kbd>, and
not the path of the current working directory, nor the Python project <kbd>project/python</kbd>.
I haven't figured out where exactly it's choosing to do this, or why, but it's probably to do with
the git root. To fix this we thankfully don't need to go forking `null-ls` and changing things, but
instead provide an override to `cwd` for the `pylama` source in our `null-ls` config, and the
simplest is just to provide the neovim evenloop cwd.

```lua
local null_ls = require("null-ls")
local diagnostics = null_ls.builtins.diagnostics
local formatting = null_ls.builtins.formatting

null_ls.setup({
    sources = {
        -- Python
        diagnostics.pylama.with({
            -- NOTE: for some reason pylama wants to start at the repository root?
            -- this means it'll miss a pylama.ini in a nested directory
            -- e.g. project/python/pylama.ini
            cwd = vim.loop.cwd,
        }),
        formatting.black,
        formatting.isort,
    },
})
```

And now everything works just the way I've wanted it to!
