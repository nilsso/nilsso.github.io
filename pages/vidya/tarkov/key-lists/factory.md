  class="badge badge-primary">Factory Key</a> This should never leave your
  secure container. On factory it opens the additional extraction point [Gate
  0][gate0], the additional extraction point [Cellars][cellars], and opens the
  [locked room](#) in third floor offices which has a possible weapon spawn,
  two coats, loose loot and occasional high end ammo. On Customs this key opens
  the [two door gas station to factory shortcut][gas-shortcut]. Where this key
  can be found: Customs 3-Story dorm guard station; Customs glass warehouse in
  the blue locker; Customs glass warehouse on the couch next to the dead scav;
  Customs checkpoint car trunk, possibly in jacket therein; in scav backpacks.
- <a href="#" class="badge badge-info">Key (pumping station)</a> Opens the
  "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area but only the door nearest
  extract. There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a
  good ambush position. This key spawns in the locker room on the bench against
  the wall close to the entrance. 
- <a href="#" class="badge badge-secondary">Key (admin)</a> Opens the "closed
  bunker" near machinery in the exit area. There is rarely anything worth
  picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This is a random
  drop now.
