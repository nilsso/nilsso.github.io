        <!-- 10/28 -->
        <li>We're not assuming what people have in their public.html. Lord knows.</li>
        <li>And so, the question is, what are you trying to pull?!</li>
        <li>What do you want see? You want to see hello world, frankly.</li>
        <li>Pound bang!</li>
        <li>That's a bit of a gotcha, when it comes to what the heck you're looking at.</li>

        <!-- 10/30 -->

        <li>It's a little basket of types</li>
        <li>Which points to another instance, which points to another instance, which points to another instance.</li>
        <li>The fprint family! Well, I haven't checked it lately.</li>
        <li>We're gonna look at the p-item. There's a p-item folder!</li>
        <li>There's p-in-it source file, a p-in-it header, which has a p-in-it function!</li>
        <li>A p-item is a personal item, it has the personal information of you. Lets look at a p-item</li>
        <li>And here's an invocation of this routine, it's called p-init. It fills in an existing empty p-item.</li>
        <li>p-in-it would be the totally wrong thing to do!</li>
        <li>What's a library? You link in the library that has what you need!</li>

        <!-- 11/4 -->

        <li>It's a little bit disturbing, a little upsetting, the way the browser understands this GIF animation files</li>
        <li>I'm going to try touching... that particular file, twave.gif. So I try to touch it, through the command-line... and look! That seems to fix the problem.</li>
        <li>Repeated... and repeated... and re... peated!</li>
        <li>You may be wondering where the array comes from. Well they come into existence with by magic. They come into existence by this little function called, split!</li>
        <li>Theres these silly dollars signs everywhere, but then you get used to them, and later you miss them. Like "where'd those silly dollar signs go?"</li>
        <li>And with die you get to include your selection of last words, but you can also include dollar bang. That's the internal diagnosis. So you get to say what you want to say, and what the system included.</li>
        <li>If you give it the wrong thing it complains and then refuses to do anything else.</li>

        <!-- 11/6 -->

        <li>Open or die!</li>
        <li>We attempt to open the file... or die!</li>
        <li>Maybe we want to spit them out after massaging them.</li>
        <li>OH IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.</li>
        <li>And... tryy-ieeeee! The keyy-ieeeee function!...</li>
        <li>That's right everybody! It's because of dollar underscore is there, lurking in the background.</li>
        <li>Don't just let your code bomb. Try to bomb gracefully!</li>

        <!-- 11/13 -->

        <li>You're in the market for good things.</li>
        <li>Etcetera, etcetera, etcetery... I mean etcetera.</li>
        <li>And if you know me, I've got more things to do than to update calendars.</li>
        <li>I have to tell you, I have to tell you! I have to tell you the big picture!</li>

        <!-- 11/18 -->

        <li>Cross your fingers and browse the thing.</li>
        <li>And look, it's the calendar!</li>
        <li>Look it's not going to be significant, unless someone whispers in your ear... You know, that files creates a file called calendar.html and you can browse it!</li>
        <li>And where are we going to spit the line? That's right! We're going to spit the line to standard out!</li>
        <li>That's okay, we'll vi it.</li>
        <li>It's like an arrow with a bang, and an arrow without a bang. It's all topsy-turvy!</li>
        <li>There's stuffing going on!</li>
        <li>Are you familiar with the finger command? It's probably not what you think.</li>
        <li>So you finger the user.</li>
        <li>Yeah, I want the bump function!</li>
        <li>And we have a global variable. It's too powerful, it's totally out of control!</li>

        <!-- 11/20 -->

        <li>And get out of here</li>
        <li>It's potentially, horrible</li>
        <li>And load it up! Load it up, with the function pointers. And all you need to do! All you need to do, it's intuitive. All you need to do!</li>
        <li>But now things are slick. Things are really slick!</li>
        <li>Here's... Here's lookin. Here's lookin at ya. Here's lookin at the code.</li>

        <!-- 11/25 -->

        <li>And what we should be asking ourselves is "Where did SCA come from"? That's a bit of a mystery.</li>
        <li>Remember the bumps.</li>
        <li>It's not going to cut the mustard.</li>
        <li>Remember the finger.</li>
        <li>That's the meaning of finger in the classical sense.</li>

        <!-- 12/2 -->

        <li>And you use the finger command on a user to see what they've been up to. It's not illegal, it's actually be standard for quite a while.</li>
        <li>For now you can think of it as hand-magic.</li>
        <li>Finger Jotto</li>

        <!-- 12/4 -->

        <li>Look... we were not able to predict the future, but... it's the future.</li>
        <li>There's all these stupid quotes!</li>
        <li>I have another level of quoting.</li>
        <li>You can make a selection of the darn movies (Of Human Bondage...)</li>
        <li>Well, here... we go!</li>
        <li>They come to your site, and they say "Oh goody!", but they click and they have to wait</li>
        <li>And compared to the other solutions, frankly I think this one looks pretty sweet. If if if, return!</p
