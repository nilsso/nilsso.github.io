# Testing a language module

The easiest way to test your own language module data is to [create a Gist][create_gist], navigate
to the raw file data (i.e. click the link that says `Raw`), and copy-paste the URL into the `Source`
field on the web-app itself, but omit everything past `.../raw/`. You'll be able to modify your own
Gist as you're pleased. Then to contribute see below.

# Contributing directly to language modules

Currently the language module for Japanese is stored [here][lang_modules], and pull requests would
be accepted, but if you're not Git savvy (and I know you, i.e. from class) you can just pass me your
additions and I'll put them in manually.

# Other notes

  Available scrips are `yarn start` to run a test server locally, and `yarn build` to build a
  optimized production bundle.
